
A concurrency based game environment

This repo contains code for my FYP project. I am creating a web based concurrent checkers game using Spring Boot that satisfies all the requirements of this project.
The project has 2 main branches for Term 1: ui_concept and concur_proto.

Within this project I aim to build a concurrent game environment. My project will focus on allowing players to multiple checkers game and these can be of different game varieties, e.g. a Chinese and International version can be played at the same time and thus this achieves the concurrency principle for this module.
